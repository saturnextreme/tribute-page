            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
             scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
             Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
             mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
             intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be
             known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
             He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
             the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            <b>1. India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV): </b>
            Working as the project director at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Dr Kalam put in over 10-year-long hard
             work for the development of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). His immense contributions ultimately
              resulted in one of the greatest scientific achievements of the country.

            <b>2. Developed indigenous guided missiles: </b>
              Dr Kalam was responsible for the development of Indigenous Guided Missiles at DRDO after having worked for 20 years at ISRO.
               He conceived the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) where he played a major role in the development and
                operationalisation of Agni and Prithvi missiles. After achieving the goal of making India self-reliant in missile technology,
                 the DRDO formally announced the successful completion of the IGMDP.

            <b>4. Creating a cost-effective stent: </b>
              Dr Kalam contributed immensely to the health sector, as well. He along with cardiologist Soma Raju developed
               a cost-effective coronary stent called ‘Kalam-Raju-Stent’ to save the lives of people who could not afford
                expensive alternatives.
